### Kobuki Obstacle Project
##### Using ROS, Gazebo, Simulink

-Established 3D model in Gazebo as project background and set up simulation environment.\
-Designed algorithm of Finite State Machine (FSM) in Simulink to optimise Kobukiâ€™s motion.\
-Implemented connection of Simulink with ROS in Virtual Machine (VM) to accomplish control Kobuki in VM from Simulink.


### LEGO EV3 robot control
##### Using Matlab, Simulink

-Built open-loop and closed-loop model in Simulink and tuned parameters in MATLAB to control two DC motors.\
-Simulated designed result in Simulink and analysed whole system to stabilise robot motion.

### Moral Machine
##### Using JAVA

-Programmed JAVA code to generate random scenario include characteristic of each person and situation.\
-Designed an algorithm addressed on the Trolley dilemma and audited numerous results as well as present result in console.
